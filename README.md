I'm a fullstack engineer with a passion for nice UI/UX. My work experience is language/framework agnostic since I wear many different hats and pick up things quickly. I enjoy learning new things so I've become a jack of all trades and I'm always eager to learn more.

My DMs are open. Feel free to send me a message!
